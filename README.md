12/22: Final Commit

After finishing our final projects for class before turning this in, completing this assignment was a breeze. All the work with jquery that we did with the final really helped out here. Implementing the chart was the hardest part of the assignment as I had very little experience with it, but digging around the Chart.js api online helped a lot.
